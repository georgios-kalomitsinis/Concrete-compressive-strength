# Concrete-compressive-strength

The Compressive Strength of Concrete determines the quality of concrete. The compression strength of concrete is a measure of the concrete's ability to resist loads which tend to compress it. It is measured by crushing cylindrical concrete specimens in compression testing machine. Concrete is the most important material in building construction, and its compressive strength is a non-linear function of its age and components. In this repo, we estimate this problem through linear regrtession techniques as a function of its characteristics.

# Dataset 

The Concrete Compressive Strength DataSet consists of 1030 observations under 9 attributes. There are 8 input variables and 1 output variable. Seven input variables represent the amount of raw material (measured in kg/m³) and one represents Age (in Days). The target variable is Concrete Compressive Strength measured in (MPa). The attributes include factors that affect concrete strength such as cement, water, aggregate (coarse and fine), and fly ash etc... Also, this dataset is obtained from [UCI Machine Learning Repository.](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/concrete+compressive+strength).
  
* Number of instances - 1030
* Number of Attributes - 9
  * Attribute breakdown - 8 quantitative inputs, 1 quantitative output
